This was a small task I started at the end of the year 2020 which used the Python package youtube-dl to allow me to download youtube videos and convert them to an mp3 format.
This is an alternate compared to using the online websites that are usually a host to malware and other harmful things

A Gui has also been developed for this script to make downloading a lot easier
